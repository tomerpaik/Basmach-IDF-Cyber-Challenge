# Basmach Hanukkah 2025 Cyber Challenge – Writeup

This repository documents my solution to a publicly released cybersecurity challenge published during Hanukkah 2025 by Basmach, the IDF's School of Computer Professions.

The challenge was solved **during the official time window**, before any solutions or walkthroughs were published.
After the challenge ended, it was officially announced that **95 participants successfully completed it**, and my solution was one of them.
Only later were public write-ups and video solutions released.

This repository focuses on documenting my original reasoning process, technical approach, and the security concepts involved, rather than presenting an optimized or polished exploit.

The full solution and analysis can be found in `solution.md`.
